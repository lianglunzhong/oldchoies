              <h3>2. HOW LONG DO POINTS REMAIN PENDING FOR? WHAT DETERMINES IF POINTS ARE ACTIVATED OR CANCELED?</h3>
              <p>Points rewarded for the first order get activated the minute and rest of orders will get activated the minute your order is shipped. That means they are being stored for you until they are activated. We just need to make sure that the sales are 100% successful. This means that the payment has been processed, no cancelling occurs before the shipment. In the event that an order is canceled before shipment, the pending points from that sale will be canceled as well. In the event that an order is partially refunded or fully refunded, the activated points from that sale will also be canceled partially or fully. This is an automatic process so unfortunately we can't speed up the process, but sit tight and soon you'll have points!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>3. IF I CANCEL MY ORDER OR RETURN ITEM(S), DO I LOSE MY POINTS?</h3>
              <p>If you cancel your order, you lose any points earned on item(s) that you cancel or later return.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>4. HOW DO I VIEW MY POINTS?</h3>

            <li>
              <h3>5. IS THERE A LIMIT ON HOW MANY POINTS CAN BE EARNED IN A DAY?</h3>
              <p>Yes, there are certain limits and thresholds on points that can be earned by doing the activities and/or combination of activities on participating sites of Points program in a day. These thresholds are controlled by complex algorithms to prevent the abuse of the reward system and to ensure the quality of the content posted.</p>
