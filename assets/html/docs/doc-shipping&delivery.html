								<h4>Frequently Asked Questions on Shipping</h4>
								<h5>1. When will my order ship?</h5>
								<p>1. Receiving Time = Processing Time + Shipping Time</p>
								<p>Processing: Usually 3-5 working days</p>
								<p>Before we ship your order, we have to prepare your products, do strict quality-control tests and carefully package the items. The time it takes to prepare your items for shipping is separate from the delivery time. Hope you could understand us.</p>
								<p>Most orders ship within 3-5 business days of purchase. Shipping times may vary due to availability of merchandise. Orders are not shipped on the weekends or holidays.</p>
								<h5>2. Where Is My Order Confirmation?</h5>
								<p>As soon as your order ships, you will receive an email confirmation to the email address you entered on your order. If for some reason, you did not receive an email, please check your spam folder and add our mail address to your safe sender list.
									If there is any problem, please feel easy to contact our Customer Service Department.</p>
								<h5>3. Will I Have To Pay International Taxes and Duties?</h5>
								<p>
									There always no extra Customers fee. But the recipient will be fully responsible for the charges if there is any. Your order may be subject to import duties and taxes, which are levied once a shipment reaches your country. This is just a general guideline
									and you should contact your customs office for specific amounts and percentages.
									<br> We cannot control and is not responsible for any duties/taxes applied to your package. You will be responsible for paying additional charges for customs clearance. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; please contact your local
									customs office for further information. Note, in rare occasions custom agents may delay delivery of some packages.
								</p>
								<h5>4. Verification of shipping</h5>
								<p>When placing your order, please make sure that you use the billing address and contact information as it appears on your credit statement. In the event that your information does not match exactly what your credit card has on file, your order
									may be held pending verification. This may require us to contact your directly. When specifying shipping address information, be sure to check that the zip code, city and state are correct. If according to delivery service's records, this information
									does not match their records, we may have to contact you to update this information and this may delay your order.</p>
								<h5>5. Do you ship to PO BOX(APO/FPO/DPO)address?</h5>
								<p>Generally speaking, we don't support this kind of service. But currently, we could only ship to P.O. Boxes and military addresses (APO, FPO) address via standard shipping.</p>
								<p>So please provide us with the most up-to-date, accurate and detailed shipping information with your phone number for the shipping. Your cooperation will be much appreciated. All parcels will be held for picking up if cannot be signed or delivered.
									If an item is returned because it was not deliverable due to an incorrect address, customer will have to be responsible for both the shipping and return charges.</p>
								<h5>6. Tracking</h5>
								<p>The tracking of your parcel is online traceable. After your order is shipped out, a confirmation email with online tracking number and link will be sent to you. The tracking will be valid for your check within 48 hours after you receive the email.</p>
								<p>
									You can also sign into your account to <a href="https://www.choies.com/track/track_order">track your order</a>.
								</p>
								<p>We sincerely suggest you add us to your email list so that you can get confirmation about your order from us. And remember to check your SPAM/JUNK folder if you do not receive a reply in 3 days.</p>
								<p>

								</p>
								<h5>7. Wrong or faulty item I received.</h5>
								<p>
									If you check that there is a fault with an item or wrong item you have received, please let us know straight away through our <a href="mailto:service@choies.com">customer service</a>team. Please include as many details including the photos as
									possible about the order and the problem with the items and we will find a decent way to solve this for you.
								</p>
								<h5>8. Missing any items in my order.</h5>
								<p>As different arrivals of the items, sometimes we don't send all items you've ordered at the same time, so some of your items will be arriving separately. There is an email saying if your items sent separately. So first check your email box and
									if there are any doubts, please feel easy to contact us.</p>
								<h5>9. You could choose express shipping if it is urgent</h5>
								<p>We are happy to provide our customers with express shipping service. However, there are additional costs to consider before choosing this option. Any customs or import duties are charged once the parcel reaches its destination country. These charges
									must be paid by the recipient of the parcel. Unfortunately, we have no control over these charges, and cannot tell you what the cost would be, as customs policies and import duties vary widely from country to country. We recommend contacting
									your local customs office for current charges before you order, so you are not surprised by charges you were not expecting.</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Notice: We feel sorry to inform you that we are unable to ship to Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria currently due to international shipping restrictions by local post offices. We would like to apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.</strong>
